# TypeScript Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a simple yet common TypeScript error: a type mismatch. The `printNumber` function is defined to accept a number, but a string is passed as an argument, resulting in a compile-time error.

The solution involves ensuring that the type of the argument passed to the function matches the type declared in the function signature.
